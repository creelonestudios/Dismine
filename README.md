# Dismine

#### Essentials, but only the essentials.

# CAUTION
This plugin is in a very early stage of development!

It may or may not slow down your server (especially ingame chat) significantly.

It may also cause unexpected crashes!

# Features and history
Dismine is a plugin that started out as a bridge between your Discord server and your Minecraft server.
It sends your chat messages to a designated channel on your Discord server, so people can read the chat even if they are not connected to the Minecraft server, and vice versa. It also displays your team prefixes, colors, and suffixes on Spigot servers (usually Bukkit/Spigot just removes them).

But Dismine has grown into something even more remarkable! We aim to replace the Essentials plugin, as it is kind of annoying and outdated. For now, you can use the chat bridge, use emote commands (details below), change your gamemode, heal yourself, as well as change your nickname and walking/flying speed! +Much more to come!

Note: Since the chat bridge is the main cause of server slowdowns / crashes, it is optional and disabled by default. See config.yml.

## Commands
- /sync - sync your Discord and Minecraft accounts
- /heal + /feed - fill your health / hunger bar
- /gm <mode> - change your gamemode, accepts 0-3, s, c, a, sp, su, survival, creative, adventure, and spectator.
- speed - change your walking/flying speed
- [NEW!] /nick - change your Minecraft nickname (does not affect your Discord name)

### Emote Commands
The commands append the following strings to the end of your message.
Most of these exist natively in Discord as well.
- /shrug - ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- /tableflip - (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
- /unflip - ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)
- /doubleflip - ┻━┻彡 ヽ(ಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻
